# PromptLab

**Your AI Prompt Engineering Platform**

---

## Welcome to the Team! 👋

Congratulations on joining the PromptLab engineering team! You've been brought on to help us build the next generation of prompt engineering tools.

### What is PromptLab?

PromptLab is an internal tool for AI engineers to **store, organize, and manage their prompts**. Think of it as a "Postman for Prompts" — a professional workspace where teams can:

- 📝 Store prompt templates with variables (`{{input}}`, `{{context}}`)
- 📁 Organize prompts into collections
- 🏷️ Tag and search prompts
- 📜 Track version history
- 🧪 Test prompts with sample inputs

### The Current Situation

The previous developer left us with a *partially working* backend. The core structure is there, but:

- There are **several bugs** that need fixing
- Some **features are incomplete**
- The **documentation is minimal** (you'll fix that)
- There are **no tests** worth mentioning
- **No CI/CD pipeline** exists
- **No frontend** has been built yet

Your job over the next 4 weeks is to transform this into a **production-ready, full-stack application**.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ (for Week 4)
- Git

### Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd promptlab

# Set up backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

API runs at: http://localhost:8000

API docs at: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Run Tests

```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Your Mission

### 🧪 Experimentation Encouraged!
While we provide guidelines, **you are the engineer**. If you see a better way to solve a problem using AI, do it!
- Want to swap the storage layer for a real database? **Go for it.**
- Want to add Authentication? **Do it.**
- Want to rewrite the API in a different style? **As long as tests pass, you're clear.**

The goal is to learn how to build *better* software *faster* with AI. Don't be afraid to break things and rebuild them better.

### Week 1: Fix the Backend
- Understand this codebase using AI
- Find and fix the bugs
- Implement missing features

### Week 2: Document Everything
- Write proper documentation
- Create feature specifications
- Set up coding standards

### Week 3: Make it Production-Ready
- Write comprehensive tests
- Implement new features with TDD
- Set up CI/CD and Docker

### Week 4: Build the Frontend
- Create a React frontend
- Connect it to the backend
- Polish the user experience
